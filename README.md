# Posting 🇵🇸 #FreePalestine on 🦋 Bluesky

This is a simple Python program to automatically post `🇵🇸 #FreePalestine` on Bluesky **every day**, powered by [the AT Protocol SDK for Python](https://github.com/MarshalX/atproto).

To use this in your Bluesky account, you can do following:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Add your Bluesky username and password in GitHub secret (`BSKY_USERNAME` and `BSKY_PASSWORD`).
3. Enable the GitHub actions workflow.
4. That's all. The workflow will start posting at 00:00 UTC every day.
5. (You can test if it's working by manually run the workflow)

Made with ❤️ for 🇵🇸
